# From version 1.7.0 there is support for caching multiple distibutions (eg
# Debian and Ubuntu) within the same apt-cacher instance. Enable this by setting
# distinct_namespaces to 1. Distribution package files are cached in separate
# directories whose names are derived from the relevant path_map key. So
# generally there will be a path_map key => server(s) setting for each
# distribution that is cached. Having enabled distinct_namespaces, existing
# packages can be imported into the correct directory by running (as root)
#
#  /usr/share/apt-cacher/apt-cacher-import.pl -u {cache_dir}/packages
#
distinct_namespaces = 1
